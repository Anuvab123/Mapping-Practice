Frameworks and Libraries used:
-
1. The following frameworks and libraries have been used in the project:

2. SpringBoot: It is an open-source Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It is used to create RESTful web services.

3. Spring Data JPA: It is a Java Persistence API (JPA) framework that allows developers to easily access databases. It provides an abstraction layer over JDBC and makes it easier to work with relational databases.

4. Hibernate: It is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for Java. It simplifies database access for Java applications by providing a framework to map Java classes to database tables.

4. MySQL: It is a widely used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is used to store and manage data in the project.


Data Flow:
-
The following is a step-by-step description of the data flow in the Ecommerce API project:

1. A client sends an HTTP request to the API endpoint.

2. The request is received by the Presentation tier of the application.

3. The Presentation tier extracts the necessary information from the request and forwards it to the Service tier.

4. The Service tier applies the necessary business logic to the request.

5. If data needs to be retrieved from the database, the Service tier requests the necessary data from the Data tier.

6. The Data tier retrieves the data from the database and returns it to the Service tier.

7. The Service tier processes the retrieved data and returns the result to the Presentation tier.

8. The Presentation tier converts the result into a JSON object and returns it to the client as an HTTP response.


Project Summary:
-
The User Mapping Project aims to develop a system that manages user relationships or mappings. It provides features for users to establish connections with others, such as friend relationships, followers/following, team members, etc. The project utilizes the Spring Boot framework, with Spring Data JPA for data persistence. Users can register, login, and update their profiles. They can send mapping requests and accept incoming requests. The system supports various mapping types, and users receive notifications for mapping updates. The application may also include search and discovery features. The project follows a layered architecture with RESTful API endpoints and can incorporate Spring Security for authentication and authorization. It can be developed using agile practices, TDD, and CI/CD. Scalability and performance considerations are taken into account, employing caching, database optimizations, and load balancing techniques
